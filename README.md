## BI-Analysis using Pentaho Data Integration & Pentaho Report Designer
Pentaho Business Intelligence Project Tutorial

# What does Business Intelligence Developer do?
Business intelligence developers make the data understandable for businesses!

Business intelligence (BI) leverages software tools to transform data into useful insights that help business decisions. 
BI tools access and analyse data sets and present analytical findings in reports, summaries, dashboards, graphs, charts, and maps to provide users with detailed intelligence about the state of the business.

# The outline for this tutorial is:

    1. Requirements Analysis
        * Requirements Gathering and Estimation
    2. Data Sources - OLTP, File-based and others
        * Analyzing data sources
        * Database Modeling
    3. Extract Transform Load
        * Staging data
        * Master data management
    4. Reporting
        * Report types - Operational, Analytical and Strategic
        * Visual Analytics



# DataSource
In a BI project, data is the currency and analytics is the merchandise.In this tutorial, we will look at different types of data sources as well as relational data modeling.  During this data movement from source to destination, the shape of the data keeps transforming. This facilitation of data movement and transformation along the way is typically known as Extract, Transform and Load (ETL).

When huge volumes of data at the scale of GBs / TBs is required for a project, we need an eagle-eye view of the data that goes beyond the reach of an Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) database. For example, let's say a national bank has 10 million transactions per day, and the CEO needs to know an average amount of these transactions for the past five years. These high volume computations are better suited for an Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) database. To meet these needs, we need to understand data marts, cubes, OLAP as well as dimensional modeling.

# Data integration ETL (Extract ,Transform , Load )
you can get data from different resours like tables,xml files,json and data warehouse.
and make changes on it
you can adding coulmn  or rows and make conditiong on data 

# Reporter Design
Finally we reach a stage where we are ready to report on the statistically computed values in a visually appealing way (i.e. reporting and analytics). We need to understand the different kinds of reports and different analytics options.
